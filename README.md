# SteelDevice

This program is made for purpose of making people lives easier.
Whoever owns a wireless mouse or headphones from Steelseries, this will help you to keep an eye on your battery state.
#
(Please keep in mind this is my first bigger github project for public :D)
#
Important!

You need to have installed python 3.12 >> https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.12.10/python-3.12.10-amd64.exe

If the app dosn't start up try opening cmd and paste this in `pip install hidapi rivalcfg pystray Pillow`

If the battery for your mouse doesn't show up try right-clicking the icon and press `Refresh`

#

How it works:
- Detects your Steelseries device
- Reads battery percentage
- Puts a icon in your tray
- Displays graficaly your battery state

Features:
- Settings for icon customization
- Customable battery colors
- Update interval
- Force update on device info

Tested devices so far:
- Aerox 5 Wireless
- Arctis Nova 5

#

Info -
This is just a test based on previously created programs here:
- https://github.com/aarol/arctis-battery-indicator
- https://github.com/yurtemre7/mouse-battery

Folder `idea` obtains files I was using to make this app

The first release is just in Alpha so there could be some issues, please report any.
I am planing to make charging detection for headphones but its difficult because of wierd responces from dongles.
Feel free to share anything with me.
