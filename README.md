Info -
This is just a test based on previously created programs here:
- https://github.com/aarol/arctis-battery-indicator
- https://github.com/yurtemre7/mouse-battery

Folder `idea` obtains files I was using to make this app

The first release is just in Alpha so there could be some issues, please report any.
I am planing to make charging detection for headphones but its difficult because of wierd responces from dongles.
Feel free to share anything with me.
